# Lending-Club-Case-Study

## Problem Statement
• Lending Club is a platform through which individual borrowers can receive loans funded by individuals who choose to invest in them.

• The objective of this analysis is to use past data of loan applications to predict the risk of default on future loans.

• There are two types of risks associated with the loan decisions. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

• We aim to identify the key drivers based on which it would be easier to predict chance of default. This would enable us to maximize the profit by keeping a healthy rate of approval for good applicants while avoiding high risk cases.
